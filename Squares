//*Is this like a notepad?

Well, it doesn't matter, lets put my idea here :

insert square shape, 16 times in a 4x4 grid in a 100px per square
next, 
First square, lets call it "S1" and it should be top left most position
the S1 should function like an on and off button,
so it must be click to turn it on.
Color is light green when on and when off its light red

Second square, lets call it "S2" and it should be next to the S1 position,
the S1 must be on first, then, the function of S2 is color change of all squares to (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) except for S1 when clicked

Third square, lets call it "S3" and it should be next to the S2 position,
the S1 must be on first, then, the function of S3 is color change to odd numbers (S1, S3, S5, S7, S9, S11, S13, S15) 
with colors (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet) except for S1 when clicked
